eSCAPE's documentation

**eSCAPE** is a parallel TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography dynamic at various space and time scales. The model accounts for hillslope processes (soil creep using **linear** diffusion), fluvial incision (**stream power law**), spatially and temporally varying tectonics (vertical displacements) and climatic forces (temporal and spatial precipitation changes and/or sea-level fluctuations).

Usage documentation and tutorials can be found on the `eSCAPE website <https://escape-model.github.io>`_

The current YAML input file format is documented in the `input for eSCAPE <https://escape-model.github.io/2018/09/input-files/>`_
